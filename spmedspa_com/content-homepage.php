      <p>Our skin is the body’s largest organ and is the first line of defense against the elements, bacteria, and a variety of other things.  At S + P MedSpa, we believe that taking care of your skin is just as important as eating well and getting enough sleep.  One of the first steps to nurturing your skin is to get regular facials and a deep treatment with the occasional chemical peel. The importance of this stems from the fact that build up on our skin is an unavoidable fact of life.  This accumulation of dirt, dead skin, and pollution can act as a barrier and prevent your skincare and vital nutrients from penetrating to the important layers of the skin.</p>
      <p>Getting regular facials and peels, performed by an experienced aesthetician, promotes healthy skin by improving skin elasticity, increasing collagen production, and leaving your skin with a healthy glow.</p>
